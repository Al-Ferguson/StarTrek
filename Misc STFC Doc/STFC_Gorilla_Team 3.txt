For the Incursion I think you will want to set your bases/ships up something like:
	-	Using https://stfc-gameplay.omnizen.xyz/crew or Leytu's Discord Crewing Bot.
	-	1 or 2 Ships set for Base Cracking. If you don't have a good Base Cracking
		Ship/Crew combo, crew these for PvP to protect Base Crackers. I plan to have 
		Enterpise:	Rom, Kirk, & HGWorf. 
		Korinar:	Khan, Otto, & Joachim
	-	A very good PvP Ship & Crew, or two. I plan on my K'T'INGA & D4

	-	An Amalgam with 2of11, 4of11, & B'Etor
	-	Your Largest Survey ship setup with a Burning crew (for Base Defense)
	-	Remaining ships (if any) setup for Base Defense	

Main Battle Plan:
__________________________________________________________________________________________

Phase 1:
	-	Group up in Elzbar (Safe House #1) immediately after Defense. When all are present, 
		we will start our Incursion into Server 61 Space.
	-	After Incursion, scout out "Safe House" (see below) and verify they are safe!
	-	Scout out Systems appropriate for Attack. Start around popular systems where 
		shields won't work, including Systems around:
			P'Jem			(Federation Territory)
			Khitomer		(Klingon Territory)
			Galorndon Core	(Romulian Territory)
			Tombstone		(Rogue Territory)
			Willenia		(Neutral Territory)
	-	Keep an Eye on AC, we have Scouts relaying targets (& big, non-Targets, to avoid).
	-	Keep an Eye Out for Big Disco's, Big PvP ships may be following.
	-	Keep an Eye Out for Big Bases showing up that were not there when we arrived.

Phase 2:
	-	Once a Target Space has been choosen, determine what type of Attack: Base or Disco
	-	All move ships at once.
	-	Upon arrival to Target System, KOS whatever you are sure you can Kill. 
	-	Keep an Eye Out for ships coming from Bases and try to hit with best PvP combo.
		Remember Combat Traiangle & scan crews when possible.
	-	We will stay for 2m-3m max (at least initially) or until Bigger ships/bases show up.
		Them back to the "Safe House" we launched from (or agreed upon alternative).

Phase 3:
	-	Once back at as "Safe House", choose the next target system and repeat Phase 2.

	-	Keep an Eye on AC, we have Scouts relaying targets (& big, non-Targets, to avoid).
	-	Every once in a while, choose a different "safe house" to return to.
	-	Keep an Eye on Base Relocation Tokens. Don't run out during an attack run!
	-	If you need to take a break & return to Server 60 Space, this is the time to do it.
		Any remaining members will make a call to continue, or return, at this point.

Safe Houses (NOTE: In #7 we will be able to shield, & probably should):

	2.	[Station Housing Gakiuel S:90203356 X:-198 Y:-465]	- Bor (L38)

	7.	[Station Housing Seoae S:76295 X:-452 Y:518]		-  Obbia (L1)
__________________________________________________________________________________________

Types of Attack:
	Base Attack:
		-	Relocate Entire Base to Station Hub in Target System.
		-	KOS all Targets in System.
		-	At conclusion of Attack, Recall ship to Base & Relocate Base to "Safe House"	
	Disco Attack:
		-	Move all attacking ships out of Base, plus Disco & Cerritos
		-	Move Disco to "adjacent" System to Target System
		-	Enable Cerritos Support on Appropriate ships, then recall Cerritos to Base
		-	Disco Summon attacking ships to "adjacent" System, then Recall Disco to Base
		-	Cloak Attacking ships
		-	Send ships into Target System (move adjacent, don't Attack until last minute).
		-	Attack Targets
		-	At conclusion of Attack, Recall ships to Base	
__________________________________________________________________________________________

Possible future Tweaks based on how things go during previous runs:
	1.	Assign Base Crackers & PvP Cover before Attack Run.
	2.	Lengthen or shorten the time we are attacking a given System.
	3.	If too crowded for all 4, split and hit 2 systems at same time.
		(risky, but will make it look like more groups are attacking)
	4.	When done, let's compare notes for things like: strange crewings, defense tactics 
		(and did they work), response times, ...
	5.	Do we want to inform AC of our target Systems so they can watch out for Cloaked
		Warp signatures and large, non-Targets, launching from their bases, big ships/bases
		coming in after we leave (alert Leytu if this happens)?
	6.	Possibly want to report back on AC during Phase 3 on System & Results. They may
		pass to other Allies to take advantage of the same System, after it has settled
		down (wait 5m-10m & have another group hit it again). 
	7.	We may want to coordinate with Leytu. If they send in big L40 ships to counter us,
		he may want to follow our attack with a Cloaked ship shortly after (disco it into
		a near by System, clock & warp to Target System)
