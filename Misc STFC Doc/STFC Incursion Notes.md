# Incursion Notes

## Always follow these rules
1. If not Active, __SHIELD__!
1. If not Active, __SHIELD__!
1. No Mining During Incursion!
1. Do __NOT__ Hive!
1. If not Active, __SHIELD__!

___

## Alliance Advanced Planning
1. Ensure Enhancers benefiting Incursion have been enabled.
   - Hull, and Advanced Hull, Enhancer
   - PvP Enhancer
   - Siege Enhancer
1. 24-36 hours before Incursion; Move all members out of Territory to <=L19 Space and __SHIELD__! Do __NOT__ Hive.
1. 18-24 hours before Incursion; begin draining unshielded members still in Territory.
1. Before Incursion, Flag Officers should remind members:
   - If not Active, __SHIELD__!
   - Do __NOT__ hit players from our Sever, unless participating in a Defensive Draining.
   - Incursion is a Team Event, and all members of our server are on our team.
   - When draining larger targets, remember ALL Members on our Sever are on the same Team. Share the spoils. There are various *bugs* that make it more efficient to drain Bases with large numbers of participants.
   - GC is monitored by both Servers, don't put *Classified* info on GC. Use AC of PC to keep it private.
   - If not Active, __SHIELD__!

___

## If not participating, or not sure your engaging, in PvP & Base Raiding
1. Move all ships back to Base and Shield!
1. Move to a <=L19 Space, do NOT create a Hive with other TTS Members or Alias (This only attracts Base Cracking).
1. Pop a 4+h shield before start of day (noon EDT).
1. Pop a 24h+ shield after start of day (if not sure, continue popping 4h+ shields until you are sure).
1. Scout for the rest of the Alliance.

___

## PvP
1. Remember the Battle Triangle
   - Explorer has advantage over Interceptor.
   - Interceptor has advantage over Battleship.
   - Battleship has advantage over Explorer.
   - Survey ships are a wash (no advantage/disadvantage) over other ships.
1. Crewing the Enterprise.
1. Crewing other ships.

## Base Cracking/Draining
1. Crewing Base Cracking ships.
   - Enterprise (or 2nd Largest Ship): Rom (C), Kirk, & HG Worf.
   - Biggest Other ship: Khan(C), Otto, & Joachim.
   - Below Decks crewing:
1. Crewing Amalgam for Capacity and Grabbing Protected Loot use 2of11(C), 4of11, & B'Etor.
1. Crewing Survey Ships for Capacity
1. Check if target crewed with Anti-Rom Crew (don't use Rom if so crewed)
1. The best attacks are:
   1. __Best when not sure if 10m Shield will deploy.__
      - Start with all ships in Base, except largest cracking ship.
      - Hit target while Cloaked.
      - If 10m shield does __not__ pop, move base and start draining.
      - If 10m shield does pop, retrieve ship to base and monitor for shield drop.
   1. __Best when sure 10m Shield won't deploy.__
      - Start with all ships in Base.
      - Move base next to target.
      - Hit target with biggest ship.
      - Begin draining operation with biggest survey ship (Amalgam).
1. If target is big enough, put the coordinates on AC to bring in help for defending & draining.
1. When Target becomes Active, or help arrives:
   - If on your own, you should probably shield.
   - If you have enough support, you may want to turn it into a PvP Slugfest (Active Base Defense good here).

## Active Base Defense
1. If not Active, SHIELD!
1. This is a great Base Defense when involved with a larger PvP Slugfest.
1. Order of ships attacked based off Battle Triangle & Size:
   - Attackers always leverage the Battle Triangle, starting with biggest ship.
   - Then attack similar ships, starting with biggest ship.
   - Then attack ships that have a battle triangle advantage, starting with biggest ship.
   - Finally attack survey ships.
1. Baby Jelly Crewing:
   - Yes, a Baby Jelly, NOT an ISS Jelly!
   - Mitigation Stripping Crew (makes Attacker suspectable to Base Defenses).
1. Big Survey Ship Crewing:
   - Your best Burning Crew.
1. Sally Crewing
1. Remaining War Ship Crewing
1. Do __NOT__ ignore hits to your base
   - This defense REQUIREs that you respond to them
   - If you don't want to respond, then __SHIELD__!
