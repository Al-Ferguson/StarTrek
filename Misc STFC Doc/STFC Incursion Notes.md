# Incursion Notes

Thanks to Laytu, USSE, and many others for the following suggestions.

## Always follow these rules
1. If not Active, __SHIELD__!
1. If not Active, __SHIELD__!
1. No Mining During Incursion!
1. Do __NOT__ Hive!
1. If not Active, __SHIELD__!

___

## Alliance Advanced Planning
1. Ensure Enhancers benefiting Incursion have been enabled.
   - Hull, and Advanced Hull, Enhancer.
   - PvP Enhancer.
   - Siege Enhancer.
1. 24-36 hours before Incursion:
   - Move all members out of Territory to <=L19 Space and __SHIELD__!
   - Do __NOT__ Hive.
1. 18-24 hours before Incursion, begin draining unshielded bases in Territory.
1. Before Incursion, Flag Officers should remind members:
   - [ ] If not Active, __SHIELD__!
   - [ ] Do __NOT__ hit players from our Sever, unless Defensive Draining.
   - [ ] Incursion is a Team Event and Our Team is all members of our Server.
   - [ ] When draining larger targets, remember:
      - ALL Members on our Sever are on the same Team.
      - Share the spoils.
      - There are *bugs* making it more efficient to drain Bases with large numbers of participants.
   - [ ] GC is monitored by both Servers!
      - Don't put *Classified* info on GC.
      - Use AC of PC to keep it private.
   - [ ] If not Active, __SHIELD__!

___

## If not participating, or not sure your engaging, in PvP & Base Raiding
1. Move all ships back to Base and Shield!
1. Move to a <=L19 Space, do NOT create a Hive with other TTS Members or Alias (This only attracts Base Cracking).
1. Pop a 4+h shield before start of day (noon EDT).
1. Pop a 24h+ shield after start of day (if not sure, continue popping 4h+ shields until you are sure).
1. Scout for the rest of the Alliance.

___

## PvP
1. Remember the Battle Triangle
   - Explorer has advantage over Interceptor.
   - Interceptor has advantage over Battleship.
   - Battleship has advantage over Explorer.
   - Survey ships are a wash (no advantage/disadvantage) over other ships.
1. Make sure your crewing gives you all your ship bonuses.
1. Try to keep Attack, Defense, and Health balanced.
1. Below Decks the following can help (best when lots of Below Deck seats available).:
   - Odo and Kira (for Critical Damage bonuses)
   - Beckett and Badgey (for additional damage bonus)
   - Tendi (for Hull Health bonus)
   - Boimler (Armor, Shield, and Dodge bonus)
   - Rutherford (Shield Health bonus)
   - Dezoc (to reduce effectiveness of targets crew). Dezoc may be the least useful during Incursion.
1. Crewing the Enterprise for PvP:
   - Gowron(C), HG Worf, Kirk (either).
   - Don't bother with Spock on bridge, Enterprise already does Shield regeneration.
1. Crewing other ships for PvP:
   - On Interceptors: 
     - Martok(C), HG Worf, and 3rd as situation dictates.
     - Gul Dukat(C), Garak, and Damar.
   - On Explorers:
     - Weyoun(C), Ikat'ika, and Pon.
   - On Battleships:
     - Lorca(C), Tilly, and 3rd as situation dictates.
     - SNW Strike Team Una or La'an as Capt, with Ortegas as 3rd Seater.
1. Having multiple types of PvP ships will allow you to leverage the Battle Triangle
1. You may not be able to crew all ships they way you want (may require same crew member on multiple ships), be ready to swap crew members or add an alternate crew member that helps the rest of the crew.

## Base Cracking/Draining
1. Crewing Base Cracking ships.
   - Enterprise (or 2nd Largest Ship): Rom(C), Kirk, & HG Worf.
   - Biggest non-Enterprise ship: Khan(C), Otto, & Joachim.
   - Below Decks crewing:
1. Crewing Amalgam for Capacity and Grabbing Protected Loot use:
   - 2of11(C), 4of11, & B'Etor.
   - B'Etor(C), 4of11, & Stonn.
   - 2of11(C), 4of11, & Stonn.
   - Include La'an Below Decks.
1. Crewing Survey Ships for Capacity
   - 2of11(C), 4of11, & Stonn.
   - Include La'an Below Decks.
1. Check if target crewed with Anti-Rom Crew (Kras(C), Rukor, and Komal), don't use if so crewed.
1. The best attacks are:
   1. __Best when not sure if 10m Shield will deploy.__
      - Start with all ships in Base, except largest cracking ship.
      - Hit target while Cloaked.
      - If 10m shield does __not__ pop, move base and start draining.
      - If 10m shield does pop, retrieve ship to base and monitor for shield drop.
   1. __Best when sure 10m Shield won't deploy.__
      - Start with all ships in Base.
      - Move base next to target.
      - Hit target with biggest ship.
      - Begin draining operation with biggest survey ship (Amalgam).
1. If target is big enough, put the coordinates on AC to bring in help for defending & draining.
1. When Target becomes Active, or help arrives:
   - If on your own, you should probably shield.
   - If you have enough support, you may want to turn it into a PvP Slugfest (Active Base Defense good here).
   
___

## Active Base Defense

This style of defense is well suited for Incursions and close in Base PvP Slugfest (e.g. Alliance Raids & Defenses). Posted elsewhere.

___
