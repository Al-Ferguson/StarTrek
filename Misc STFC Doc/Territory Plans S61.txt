We need to connect Territories together, given order of TO/Defense times we need to take:
    1.  Adia
    2.  Tezera
    3.  Tigan
    4.  Crios
    5.  Corva
    
Remember:
    1.  In 1* & 2* Territories; whomever holds Beta gets the Territory (more Capture nodes, 
        so more points available).
    2.  These are un-owned, so we can get in and setup whenever we want. Also, setting up
        before hand is not a violation of the Merged Server 61 RoE.
    3.  Use Allies for PvP, avoid contact where possible.
    4.  Admiral or Cmdrs Declare immediately (we will need all the points we can get)

Scouting:
	1.	Cmdr(s) send in Cloaked Ship to Alpha & Beta (& Gamma, if applicable). 
		Time so cloak will last 1m into TO.
	2.	Report to flag officers & allies what they see (Discord channel?)

Setup:
	3.	All Declaring Alliance Capture Nodes ships will cloak and time to arrive at 4m to TO.
		After arriving take up positions next to the Capture Node they will be Occupying. If
		opposition ship already on Node, try to make sure you can beat it in Node PvP.
	4.	Remaining Declaring Alliance ships w/cloaking will cloak and time to arrive 1m to TO
	5.	Allies with cloaking will also time their arrive for 1m before TO.
		Position near capture Nodes and/or bigger opponents.
	6.	Remaining non-cloaked Declaring Alliance ships will time to arrive ~30s before TO.
	7.	Non-cloaked Allies will time to arrive 15s after TO begins.

Declare and Execute:
	6.	At the Declaration Alert, Node Capture ships will Occupy their Nodes.
	7.	Cloaked ships will stay put until cloaks time out, then try to stay alive.
	8.	Allies will attempt to do ALL PvP. Bigger cloaked ships taking out bigger opponents.
	9.	Declaring Alliance non-cloaked ships will try to stay alive and out of PvP as much 
		as possible. We need survival time, not PvP victories. 
		
If a Capture Node is empty/taken; try to have Ally clear it, then Declaring Alliance Occupy it.


_______________


3 Groups in Declaring Alliance: Node Squad, Cloaked Squad, and all others
2 Groups in Allies: Cloaked Squad and all other PvP ships

Ideally, no Ally visible before TO is Declared.
Ideally, Node Squad captures all nodes as soon as TO is Declared.
Ideally, Allies do all PvP and Declaring Alliance just collects the points
Ideally, If a Capture Node falls to an opponent, an Ally will clear it then let
	someone from the Declaring Alliance re-occupy it.
