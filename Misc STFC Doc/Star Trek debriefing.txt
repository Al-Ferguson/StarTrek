Station Cracking Event Debriefing


- 	I found an Unshielded Station with >100M of all three materials. L28 [LF] CaptnShltForBains
- 	I Hit Station cracking it and activating 10 min shield.
- 	My ship returns home for repairs.

- 	10 minutes pass, no activity from occupant or [LF].

- 	10 min Shield comes down
- 	Myself CaptAllanon, and CaptMightMouse commence cleaning out base
- 	10 mins later, no defense activity, so we announce it is open to all on AC. 
- 	At least 3 TTS members join in (and one EMC member picking up scraps with an Envoy)
- 	At 1 hour mark, a lon LF defender shows up
- 	After short pause LF defender begins attacking our Survey ships
- 	After 3-4 TTS Survey Ships destroyed, he attacks one of mine & destroys himself.
- 	TTS brings bigger ships to stand guard and continues draining the Station
- 	About 10 minutes later LF shows up with a small force
- 	Then 1-2 MERK ships join them ([MERK] RobtheCanadian' D3 & another).
- 	The LF & MERK begin hitting our ships.
	[MERK] RobtheCanadian's D3 took out my survey ships and then hit my Sally, self-destructing
- 	At this point we start fighting back.
- 	I loss 1 survey ship & 1 was damaged; 
- 	then they started hitting my Sally & Intrepid; and self destructing
- 	Our defense ships then mopped up the defenders
- 	We called the raid and returned home to work on dailies.

- 	[MERK] IKilledSparticus & 4 other [MERK] ships showed up with some [LF] defenders

- 	After about a half hour all the [LF] defenders & [MERK] IKilledSparticus left

- 	I sent my Sally back for another load.
- 	Stopped infront of Base, then got another load
- 	The 3 [LF] ships attacked me and promptly self-destructed.
	(CaptainSchlock's Sally & Centurion, plus Mindful42o's Intrepid) 
- 	I left to finish dailies

- 	[MERK] IKilledSparticus returned



I purposely did NOT attack with my Sally for number of reasons:
	-	RoE says shield or share, so we were staying in RoE on purpose.
	-	[MERK] was not "officially" involved
	-	The Sally's special ability is defense. It gets a 36% Shield Bonus when attacked!
	-	From clarifications between you & myself, I was trying NOT to provoke a war.
	
If you need them, I have screen shots that show the above order and that [MERK] was the 
"aggressor", i.e. I did NOT hit him, he hit me.
