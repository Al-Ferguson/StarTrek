# WARNING

This is a great __Active__ Base Defense when involved in a larger PvP Slugfest (e.g. Alliance Base Raiding, Alliance Base Defense, and Incursions). The idea is to make your Base as non-One Hit Crackable as possible, cost the Attacker much more then it cost you, and allow you to be effective in the greater PvP Slugfest; ALL at the same time.

__But__ this __requires__ you to Actively monitor, and respond, to any attacks that happen. If you don't, you will quickly loose the advantage this defense provides! A key factor in this defense is how quickly, and cheaply (0-1 Latinum instant Fix), you can restore it after an attack. If you don't, you will loose your Base, Ships, and contents quickly!

## This defense can be dangerous if you are not actively engaged
1. Read this in its entirety before attempting to implement this!
1. This defense __REQUIREs__ you Actively Respond to all Attacks!
1. This defense __REQUIREs__ you to have a _Baby_ Jelly, __NOT__ an ISS Jelly!
1. This defense __REQUIREs__ you to have a Medium to Large Base with amplified Defense Platforms.
1. This defense will __NOT__ hold out long to prolonged attacks. You Must Actively Respond to all Attacks!
1. This defense works best during an Incursion, particularly during close in Base PvP Slugfests.
1. Do __NOT__ ignore hits to your base!
   - This defense __REQUIREs__ you Actively Respond to all Attacks!
   - If you don't want to respond, then __SHIELD__!)
   - If you don't respond, you will be cracked and draining will follow quickly!
1. If you can not keep up with the Active Requirement of this defense; __SHIELD__!
1. You really need at least 6 Dry Docks for this to be effective!
1. You really need at least 5 Defense Platforms for this to be effective!

## Why/How it works
1. This defense works by Crewing to make Attackers more suspectable to Base Defense Platforms.
1. This defense costs the attacker the most, and the defender the least.
1. This defense prevents most one-hit cracks (and reduces base damage) and bring ships back online quickly.
1. The first key is the order of attack on Docked Ships, i.e. the Battle Triangle:
   - Attackers always leverage the Battle Triangle, starting with smallest ship the opposite class.
   - Then attack similar ships, starting with smallest ship.
   - Then attack ships that have a the advantage, starting with smallest ship.
   - Finally they attack survey ships, starting with smallest ship.
1. The second key is the crewing of very specific Ships to:
   - Strip, and Bypass, attackers Shields.
   - Burn the Attackers Ship (increasing Attack Damage).
   - Breach the Attackers Hull (increasing Attack Damage).
   - Amplify the effectiveness of the Defense Platforms.

## Abridged Ship and Crewing Table
![Abridged Ship & Crewing](./imgs/Abriged%20Ship%20%26%20Crewing%20Table.png)

| Slot | Ship | Captain | 2nd Seat | 3rd Seat | Purpose |
| ---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| 1 | Realta | Picard | Bev| Harrison | Shield bypass 1st Round |
| 2 | Toras | Kras | Rukor | Komal | Anti Rom, Damage Reduction |
| 3 | Toras | Tilly | Burnham | Saru | Shield Stripping |
| 4 | Baby Jelly | Yuki | Marcus| Zhou | Shield Stripping |
| 5 | Fortunate | Lorca | Gorkon | Georgiou | Hull Breach & Burning |

## Abridged Ship and Crewing Details

1. Docked Warship Crewing:
   - If you don't have VERY BIG ships to last many rounds, use multiple Turas. These are quick & cheap to repair during attack.
   - Picard(C), Bev, and Harrison (Realta Explorer good choice).
     - Strips shields from Attacker the first round, making them suspectable to Base Defense Platforms.
     - __Probably__ the first ship to restore, if destroyed.
   - Kras(C), Rukor, and Komal (Turas Explorer, anti-Rom Damage Reduction).
   - Tilly(C), Burnham, and Saru (Turas Explorer good choice).
1. Baby Jelly Crewing (always required):
   - Yes, a Baby Jelly, __NOT__ an ISS Jelly!
   - Shield Stripping Crew: Yuki(C), Marcus, and Zhou.
   - Strips shields from Attacker starting after 2nd round, making them suspectable to Base Defense Platforms.
   - __Probably__ the second ship to restore, if destroyed.
1. Survey Ship Crewing:
   - If you are using this ship for Base Raiding as well, make it your biggest survey ship.
   - If you are not using this for Base Raiding, use a Fortunate (or two). These are quick & cheap to repair during attack.
   - Your best Hull Breach/Burning Crews are:
     - Lorca(C), Gorkon, and Georgiou (ECS Fortunate).
     - Gorkon(C), Lorca, and Nero (ECS Fortunate).
     - Georgiou(C), Tyler, and 3rd as situation dictates (ECS Fortunate alt crewing).

## Bold Defense vs Regular Defense outcomes

Coming Soon

## Advanced Ship Slotting Options (publish after Bold Defense Course?)

1. For Mid-Level Members (L30-L48), leverage ships that are quick, and cheap, to repair.
   - Baby Jelly Explorer
   - The Realta Explorer
   - The Turas Explorer
   - The ECS Fortunate Survey Ships
1. For Higher Level Members (L49+ with most of their research completed), they can use larger ships:
   - Baby Jelly Explorer (always required).
   - Very Large Explorer (if not available, use a Realta Explorer).
   - Large 2nd Explorer (if available).
     - Helps keep Baby Jelly alive
     - If available, this is where I would crew with Picard(C), Bev, and Harrison.
   - Very Large Survey Ships (if not available, use an ECS Fortunate)
     - Large Capacity Survey ships make for quick Base Raiding.
     - Large Capacity Survey ships make survive better against a simple Base Repair Defense.
     - More Powerful Survey ships with Burning, and Hull Breaching, crews destroy Attackers more quickly.
   - If you are big enough, and have the larger ships, they can do double duty:
     - Perform duties for Active Base Defense.
     - Perform PvP duties for Warships, when away from Base.
     - Perform Base Cracking Duties, when away from Base.
     - Perform Base Draining Duties for Survey ships, when away from Base.
1. As you get bigger, modify the original ships by:
   - Using your Amalgam, or larger Survey ship, to replace a Survey ship from the original list.
     - Use the Georgiou(C), Tyler, and a Storage Optimization Crew member for this ship so:
       - It remains a very good Burning Crew ship when in Base.
       - Has a large capacity when Base Stripping.
     - Use Below Decks crewing to enhance Storage Optimization and/or Burning.
   - Add a bigger, more survivable Explorer to crew with Picard(C), Bev, and Harrison.
     - While the main purpose of this ship is completely in the first round of defense, the longer it survives, the longer the Baby Jelly is around. Prolonging its Shield Stripping capabilities.
   - If you have more than 5 Dry Docks (and therefore ships), consider crewing:
     - A large Base Cracking ship.
       - Crew appropriately (see #incursion-event thread Base Cracking/Draining section).
       - Battleships are usually best suited for Base Cracking, as they have best Hull Health.
       - Explorers are close second for Base Cracking.
     - A large PvP ship (or two).
       - Crew a Battleship with SNW Strike Team Una or La'an as Capt, & Ortegas as 3rd Seater.
       - Crew an Explorer with Weyoun(C), Ikat'ika, & Pon.
       - Crew an Interceptor with Gul Dukat(C), Garak, & Damar.
       - Particularly effective against an Attacker w/o Shields!
     - A second (or even third) large Survey Ship:
       - Still Crew for Burning and Hull Breach as this also helps survivability when Base Stripping.
       - Use Below Decks Crewing to balance capacity with primary Base Stripper.
       - Allows for use of multiple stripping ships (every 5s) when it makes sense.
1. Where to concentrate upgrade efforts:
   - Improving Crew Level, and Power, is quickest payback.
   - Improving Health, and Fire Power, of Station Defenses is next.
   - Until you have >6 Dry Docks, don't worry about ships beyond the standard ships.
   - With >=7 Dry Docks, start adding good PvP Ships & Crews.
   - Until your Level, Power, and research are there; stick with the standard configuration.
   - When you can survive multiple rounds of attacks from bigger Attackers:
     - Replace 1, or 2, Explorers with bigger Explorers. __BUT NEVER__ replace the Baby Jelly!
     - Replace standard Survey Ships with Bigger ones.
     - Replace a PvP Ship with a good Base Cracking ship.

## How to Spot a Practitioner of the Bold Defense
- Important when Base Cracking, as you do not want to be the Victim!
- The Signs are:
  1. A Baby Jelly with Yuki as Captain.
  1. Picard Captaining a small warship.
  1. Multiple Survey Ships with Burning Crew Captains.
- Skip this base, it will be costly to crack at best!
- If they crewed properly, they can potentially defeat an Attacker up to 20 Levels higher!
- So Rule #1 when Base Cracking: "Check to make sure the Target is not practicing a Bold Defense!"
