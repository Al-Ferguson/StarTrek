# WARNING

This is a great Base Defense when involved with a larger PvP Slugfest (e.g. Alliance Base Raiding and Base Defense). The idea is to make your Base as non-One Hit Crackable as possible, and allow you to be effective in a PvP Slugfest.

## This defense can be dangerous if you are not actively engaged
1. Read this in its entirety before attempting to implement this!
1. This defense __REQUIREs__ you Actively Respond to all Attacks!
1. This defense __REQUIREs__ you to have a _Baby_ Jelly, __NOT__ an ISS Jelly!
1. This defense __REQUIREs__ you to have a Medium to Large Base with amplified Defense Platforms.
1. This defense will __NOT__ hold out long to prolonged attacks. You Must Actively Respond to all Attacks!
1. This defense works best during an Incursion, particularly during close in Base PvP Slugfests.
1. Do __NOT__ ignore hits to your base!
   - This defense __REQUIREs__ you Actively Respond to all Attacks!
   - If you don't want to respond, then __SHIELD__!
   - If you don't respond, you will be cracked and draining will follow quickly!
1. If you can not keep up with the Active Requirement of this defense; __SHIELD__!
1. You really need at least 6 Dry Docks for this to be effective!
1. You really need at least 5 Defense Platforms for this to be effective!

## Why/How it works
1. This defense works by Crewing to make Attackers more suspectable to Base Defense Platforms.
1. This defense costs the attacker the most, and the defender the least.
1. This defense prevents most one-hit cracks (and reduces base damage) and bring ships back online quickly.
1. The first key is the order of attack on Docked Ships:
   - Attackers always leverage the Battle Triangle, starting with biggest ship in that class.
   - Then attack similar ships, starting with biggest ship.
   - Then attack ships that have a battle triangle advantage, starting with biggest ship.
   - Finally attack survey ships.
1. The second key is the crewing of very specific Ships to:
   - Strip and Bypass attackers Shields.
   - Burn the Attackers Ship (increasing Attack Damage).
   - Breach the Attackers Hull (increasing Attack Damage).
   - Amplify the effectiveness of the Defense Platforms.

## Abridged Ship and Crewing Table
![Abridged Ship & Crewing](./imgs/Abriged%20Ship%20%26%20Crewing%20Table.png)

| Slot | Ship | Captain | 2nd Seat | 3rd Seat | Purpose |
| ---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| 1 | Realta | Picard | Bev| Harrison | Shield bypass 1st Round |
| 2 | Toras | Kras | Rukor | Komal | Anti Rom, Damage Reduction |
| 3 | Toras | Tilly | Burnham | Saru | Shield Stripping |
| 4 | Baby Jelly | Yuki | Marcus| Zhou | Shield Stripping |
| 5 | Fortunate | Lorca | Gorkon | Georgiou | Hull Breach & Burning |

<details><summary>Abridged Active Base Defense Details</summary>

1. Baby Jelly Crewing (always required):
   - Yes, a Baby Jelly, NOT an ISS Jelly!
   - Shield Stripping Crew: Yuki(C), Marcus, and Zhou.
   - Makes Attacker suspectable to Base Defenses.
1. Docked Warship Crewing:
   - If you don't have VERY BIG ships to last many rounds, use multiple Turas. These are quick & cheap to repair during attack.
   - Picard, Bev, and Harrison (Realta Explorer good choice).
   - Kras(C), Rukor, and Komal (Turas Explorer, anti-Rom Damage Reduction).
   - Tilly(C), Burnham, and Saru (Turas Explorer good choice).
1. Survey Ship Crewing:
   - If you are using this ship for Base Raiding as well, make it your biggest survey ship.
   - If you are not using this for Base Raiding, use a Fortunate (or two). These are quick & cheap to repair during attack.
   - Your best Hull Breach/Burning Crew:
     - Lorca(C), Gorkon, and Georgiou (ECS Fortunate).
     - Gorkon(C), Lorca, and Nero (ECS Fortunate).
     - Georgiou(C), Tyler, and 3rd as situation dictates (ECS Fortunate alt crewing).

1. For Medium Level Members (L30-L49), this leverages ships that are quick and cheap to repair.
   - Baby Jelly Explorer
   - The Realta Explorer
   - The Turas Explorer
   - The ECS Fortunate Survey Ships
1. For Large Level Members (L50+ with most of their research completed), they can use larger ships:
   - Baby Jelly Explorer (still required)
   - Very Large Explorer (if not available, use a Realta Explorer)
   - Large 2nd Explorer (helps keep Baby Jelly alive)
   - Very Large Survey Ships (if not available, use an ECS Fortunate)
   - If you are big enough, and have the larger ships, they can do double duty:
     - Perform duties for Active Base Defense
     - Perform PvP duties for Warships
     - Perform Base Cracking Duties
     - Perform Base Draining Duties
