## Active Base Defense (Very Abridged Edition)
1. This is a great Base Defense when involved with a larger PvP Slugfest.
1. The key is the order of attack on Docked Ships:
   - Attackers always leverage the Battle Triangle, starting with biggest ship in that class.
   - Then attack similar ships, starting with biggest ship.
   - Then attack ships that have a battle triangle advantage, starting with biggest ship.
   - Finally attack survey ships.
1. Baby Jelly Crewing:
   - Yes, a Baby Jelly, NOT an ISS Jelly!
   - Shield Stripping Crew: Yuki (C), Marcus, and Zhou.
   - Makes Attacker suspectable to Base Defenses.
1. Docked War Ship Crewing:
   - If you do not have VERY BIG ships that will last many rounds, use multiple Turas. Thees are quick, and cheap, to repair during attack.
   - Picard, Bev, and Harrison (Realta good choice).
   - Tilly (C), Burnham, and Saru.
   - Kras (C), Rukor, and Komal (alternative crewing).
1. Survey Ship Crewing:
   - If you are using this ship for Base Raiding as well, make it your biggest survey ship.
   - If you are not using this ship for Base Raiding, use a Fortunate (or two). These are quick, and cheap, to repair during attack.
   - Your best Hull Breach/Burning Crew:
     - Lorca (C), Gorkon, and Georgiou (Fortunate).
     - Gorkon (C), Lorca, and Nero (Fortunate).
     - Georgiou (C), Tyler, and 3rd as situation dictates (Fortunate alternative crewing).
